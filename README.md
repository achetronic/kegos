A daemon process to automatically synchronize Google Workspace (GSuite) group memberships for users present in Keycloak, following an authoritative approach.

## Motivation

While Keycloak can authenticate users against Google Workspace via OIDC, it doesn't automatically sync Google Workspace group memberships. Users may belong to various groups in Google Workspace that define their permissions and roles, but these group memberships are not reflected in Keycloak by default.

This synchronizer bridges that gap by continuously monitoring users in Keycloak and automatically syncing their Google Workspace group memberships. As users authenticate to Keycloak, their Google Workspace groups are automatically added to their Keycloak profile, enabling proper authorization and role-based access control.

## How it works

1. **Discovery**: KEGOS retrieves all users from the specified Keycloak realm
2. **Group Resolution**: For each user, it queries Google Workspace Admin API to get their group memberships
3. **Synchronization**: Groups are created in Keycloak if they don't exist, and users are added/removed from groups to match Google Workspace
4. **Continuous Sync**: The process repeats at configurable intervals to keep memberships up-to-date

## Flags

Every configuration parameter can be defined by flags that can be passed to the CLI.
They are described in the following table:

| Name                       | Description                                               | Default | Example                                            |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|:--------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `--log-level`              | Define the verbosity of the logs                          | `info`  | `--log-level debug`                                |
| `--gsuite-credentials`     | Path to Google Workspace service account credentials JSON | -       | `--gsuite-credentials="/path/to/credentials.json"` |
| `--gsuite-domain`          | Google Workspace domain to sync groups from               | -       | `--gsuite-domain="company.com"`                    |
| `--keycloak-uri`           | Keycloak server URI                                       | -       | `--keycloak-uri="https://auth.company.com"`        |
| `--keycloak-realm`         | Keycloak realm to sync users and groups                   | -       | `--keycloak-realm="master"`                        |
| `--keycloak-client-id`     | Keycloak client ID with admin permissions                 | -       | `--keycloak-client-id="kegos"`                      |
| `--keycloak-client-secret` | Keycloak client secret                                    | -       | `--keycloak-client-secret="super-secret"`          |
| `--reconcile-interval`     | Time between synchronization cycles (duration format)     | `10m`   | `--reconcile-interval="5m"`                        |
| `--synced-parent-group`    | Keycloak group where to sync Gsuite groups                | -       | `--synced-parent-group="google-workspace"`         |
| `--help`                   | Show help information                                     | `false` | `--help`                                           |

## Prerequisites

### Google Workspace Setup

1. Create a service account in Google Cloud Console
2. Enable the Admin SDK API
3. Download the service account JSON credentials
4. Grant domain-wide delegation to the service account
5. In Google Admin Console, authorize the service account with the following OAuth scopes:
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.readonly`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly`

### Keycloak Setup

1. Create a client in Keycloak with service account enabled
2. Assign the following client roles from `realm-management`:
- `manage-users` (to manage user group memberships)
- `view-users` (to read user information)
- `manage-realm` (to create and manage groups)

## Examples

Here you have a complete example to use this command:

```console
kegos \
 --log-level=info \
 --gsuite-credentials="/opt/kegos/gsuite-credentials.json" \
 --gsuite-domain="freepik.com" \
 --keycloak-uri="https://keycloak.freepik.com" \
 --keycloak-realm="employees" \
 --keycloak-client-id="kegos-sync" \
 --keycloak-client-secret="your-client-secret" \
 --reconcile-interval="15m" \
 --synced-parent-group="google-workspace"
```

## How to use

This project provides binary files and Docker images to make it easy to use wherever wanted.

### Binaries

Binary files for the most popular platforms will be added to the [releases](https://github.com/achetronic/kegos/releases)

### Docker

Docker images can be found in GitHub's [packages](https://github.com/achetronic/kegos/pkgs/container/kegos)
related to this repository.

```bash
docker run --rm \
 -v /path/to/gsuite-creds.json:/credentials.json:ro \
 ghcr.io/achetronic/kegos:latest \
 --gsuite-credentials="/credentials.json" \
 --gsuite-domain="your-domain.com" \
 --keycloak-uri="https://your-keycloak.com" \
 --keycloak-realm="your-realm" \
 --keycloak-client-id="your-client" \
 --keycloak-client-secret="your-secret" \
 --synced-parent-group="google-workspace"
```

## Security Considerations

- Store the Keycloak client secret securely (consider using environment variables or secret management)
- Limit the Google Workspace service account permissions to read-only
- Use a dedicated Keycloak client with minimal required permissions
- Monitor logs for authentication failures or API rate limits
